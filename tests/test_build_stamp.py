"""The package knows the commit it was built from.

Stamped by `git archive` through `export-subst` (see `_build.py`). Two
things can silently stop the stamping: the file moving without its
attribute, or the attribute naming a file that no longer exists. Either
leaves every install reporting "development build", and nothing would
fail. This fails.
