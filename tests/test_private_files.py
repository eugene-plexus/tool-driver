"""The config file -- which holds the backend's API key -- is 0600.

With no master key the key is on disk in plaintext (a standalone driver,
or the window before the operator unlocks), so the file's mode is the
only thing between the key and every other account on the host.

Two kinds of test, because CI is Linux and this box is Windows. The
POSIX one reads the mode off the finished file -- the property itself.
The platform-independent ones watch `os.open` and assert the file was
*created* asking for `0600` through an exclusive temp; before the fix
they fail on both, because `Path.open` never calls `os.open` at all.
