"""Verifier bootstrap: the trust bundle this driver checks tokens against.

Per-node token keys (2026-09-25; `specs/docs/design/per-node-token-keys.md`).
The supervising agent hands this process four things and no key:

* `TRUST_BUNDLE_FILE` -- the bundle the agent keeps and rewrites when
  the control root publishes a new one; reloaded when it changes;
* `TRUST_AUTHORITY` -- the key that bundle must be signed by, so a file
  anyone else wrote is refused;
* `AUTH_RECIPIENT` -- which machine this is (`node:<name>`), the
  audience a token must name to be accepted here;
* `SERVICE_TOKEN` -- this driver's own token, addressed to this
  machine alone, which it shows this machine's agent to resolve a
  runtime's address.

`MASTER_KEY` is the separate at-rest encryption credential. With none of
the first four, the driver runs unauthenticated (dev/standalone), as it
always has; with some but not all, it refuses to start rather than run
half-authenticated.
